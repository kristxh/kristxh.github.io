## Introduction

* The purpose of this exploratory data analysis is to answer questions from Budweiser related to the craft beer industry in the United States.

```{r}
# Import dependencies
library(tidyverse)
library(dplyr)
library(ggplot2)
library(data.table)
library(ggthemes)
library(naniar)
library(class)
library(caret)
library(plotly)
library(GGally)
library(ggpubr)
library(tidycensus)
library(fiftystater) # Latitude and longitude for 50 states
data(fifty_states) # Import the data

# Import Beer and Brewery data
beer_df <-  read_csv("Beers.csv")
brew_df <-  read_csv("Breweries.csv")
cities_df <- read_csv("cities.csv", col_types = list(col_character(), col_double(), col_double()))

# Check to make sure data imported
dim(beer_df)
dim(brew_df)
View(brew_df)

```

## 1.  How many breweries are present in each state?

* Colorado has the most number of craft breweries.

```{r}
#  Group breweries by state
brew_by_state <- brew_df %>% group_by(State) %>% summarize(count=n())

# Display # of breweries by state
View(brew_by_state)

```


```{r, fig.width=10, fig.height=5}

# Plot # of breweries by state in a barchart
p <- brew_by_state %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = State, y = count)) +
  geom_bar(stat = "identity", fill = "blue", alpha = .5) +
  ggtitle("Number of Breweries by State") + xlab("State") + ylab("Number of Breweries") +
  geom_text(aes(y = count, label = count), fontface = "bold", vjust = -.4, color = "black", size = 3) 

p + rotate_x_text(45)

```


```{r}
# In order to plot the count of breweries on the states using the fifty_states data, get the full state names and add them to the brew_by_state df

                       )
    
  # Create a df of state codes from x variable
  st_abbr_df <- data.frame(state=x)
    
  # Match state codes with codes from 'st_codes' df and use it to return the full state name
  ret_state <- st_codes$full[match(st_abbr_df$state,st_codes$st_abbr)]
  print(ret_state)
   
  # Return the full state names in the same order in which they appeared in the original source
  return(ret_state)
}

brew_by_state$id <- state_from_lower(brew_by_state$State)

```

```{r, fig.width=10, fig.height=8}

# Plot the US map with the number of craft breweries as labels and points for Budweiser locations.  The fifty_states data 
map_w_brew <- ggplot(data = brew_by_state, aes(map_id = id)) + 
  geom_map(aes(fill = count),  color= "white", map = fifty_states) + 
  expand_limits(x = fifty_states$long, y = fifty_states$lat) +
  coord_map() + 
  ggtitle("Number of Breweries by State with Anheser-Busch Brewery Locations") +
  geom_text(data = fifty_states %>%
              group_by(id) %>%
              summarise(lat = mean(c(max(lat), min(lat))),
                        long = mean(c(max(long), min(long)))) %>%
              mutate(state = id) %>%
              left_join(brew_by_state, by = "id"), aes(x = long, y = lat, label = count))+
  scale_x_continuous(breaks = NULL) + scale_y_continuous(breaks = NULL) +
  labs(x = "", y = "") + theme(legend.position = "bottom", 
                               panel.background = element_blank()) 

map_w_brew  + geom_point(data = cities_df, aes(longitude, latitude), size = 3, color = "red", inherit.aes=FALSE)


```

## 2.  Merge the Beer Data with the Brewery Data.  Print first and last six observations.

```{r}
# Change the column names in the Beer df
setnames(beer_df, old=c("Name","Brewery_id"), new=c("Beer_name", "Brew_ID"))

# Change column name in the Brewery df
setnames(brew_df, old=c("Name"), new=c("Brewery_name"))

# Make the state column a factor
brew_df$State <-  factor(brew_df$State)
str(brew_df)

# Merge the brewery data with the beer data (left join)
all_df <- merge(beer_df, brew_df, by="Brew_ID")
dim(all_df)

# Print the first & last 6 observations
(first6= head(all_df,6))
(last6= tail(all_df,6))
```

## 3.  Address the missing values in each column

* The beers with missing ABV, IBU, or Style values were not included in the ABV, IBU, and IPA/Ale analysis.

```{r}
# count missing values in each column
s = sapply(all_df, function(x) sum(is.na(x)))
s

gg_miss_var(all_df)

# Remove missing data for beer & rename the Name and Brewery_id Columns
clean_df <- all_df %>% filter(!is.na(ABV) & !is.na(IBU) & !is.na(Style))
dim(clean_df)
```

## 4.  Compute the median alcohol content and international bitterness unit for each state.  Plot a bar chart to compare.

* Maine has the highest median ABV and IBU of all the states. Arkansas and Utah have the lowest median ABV, while Wisconsin has the lowest median IBU.

```{r}
# Dataframe with median values for ABV and IBU
(med_abv_ibu <- clean_df %>% 
  group_by(State) %>%
  summarize(med_abv = median(ABV), med_ibu = median(IBU), count = n()))

```

```{r, fig.width=20, fig.height=10}

# Plot the median ABV & IBU
p2 <- ggplot(med_abv_ibu, aes(x = State)) +
  geom_col(aes( y = med_ibu, fill="redfill")) +
  geom_text(aes(y = med_ibu, label = med_ibu), fontface = "bold", vjust = 2.4, color = "white", size = 4) +
  geom_line(aes(y = med_abv * 1000, group = 1, color = 'blackline')) +
  geom_text(aes(y = med_abv * 1000, label = round(med_abv, 2)), vjust = -.4, color = "black", size = 4) +
  scale_y_continuous(sec.axis = sec_axis(trans = ~ . / 1000)) +
  scale_fill_manual('', labels = 'Median Bitterness (IBU)', values = "#C00000") +
  scale_color_manual('', labels = 'Median Alcohol By Volumn (ABV)', values = 'black') +
  ggtitle("Median Alcohol Content & International Bitterness by State") +
  theme_minimal()

p2 + rotate_x_text(45)

```

## 5.  Which state has the maxiumum alcoholic (ABV) beer?  Which state has the most bitter (IBU) beer?

* Kentucky has the highest ABV beer, which is called ‘London Balling’,  made by Against the Grain Brewery, located in Louisville city.
* Oregon has the highest IBU beer, which is called ‘Bitter Bitch Imperial IPA’, made by Astoria Brewing Company, located in Astoria city.
```{r}
# Dataframe with maximum values for ABV and IBU
max_abv_ibu <- clean_df %>% group_by(State) %>% summarize(max_abv = max(ABV), max_ibu = max(IBU), count = n())

#List row with max ABV
view(clean_df[which.max(clean_df$ABV),])

#List row with max IBU
view(clean_df[which.max(clean_df$IBU),])

```

```{r, fig.width=20, fig.height=10}

# Plot max values for ABV and IBU
p3 <- ggplot(max_abv_ibu, aes(x = State)) +
  geom_col(aes( y = max_ibu, fill="redfill")) +
  geom_text(aes(y = max_ibu, label = max_ibu), fontface = "bold", vjust = 2.4, color = "white", size = 4) +
  geom_line(aes(y = max_abv * 1400, group = 1, color = 'blackline')) +
  geom_text(aes(y = max_abv * 1400, label = round(max_abv, 2)), vjust = -.4, color = "black", size = 4) +
  scale_y_continuous(sec.axis = sec_axis(trans = ~ . / 1400)) +
  scale_fill_manual('', labels = 'Max Bitterness (IBU)', values = "#C00000") +
  scale_color_manual('', labels = 'Max Alcohol By Volumn (ABV)', values = 'black') +
  ggtitle("Max Alcohol Content & International Bitterness by State") +
  theme_minimal()

p3 + rotate_x_text(45)

```

## 6.  Comment on the summary statistics and distribution of the ABV variable.

* The distribution of ABV variable is slightly right-skewed.

```{r}
#Summary of key statistics of ABV
summary(clean_df$ABV)

#Outliers
OutVals = boxplot(clean_df$ABV, plot=FALSE)$out
hist(OutVals)

# Plot boxplot
clean_df %>%
  ggplot(aes(y = ABV)) +
  geom_boxplot() +
  ggtitle("Summary Statistics of the ABV") + ylab("ABV")

```

```{r, fig.width=10, fig.height=5}
# Plot histogram of the ABV distribution
clean_df %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = ABV)) +
  geom_histogram(colour="black",fill="navy") +
  ggtitle("Distribution of ABV") + xlab("ABV")

# t-test
t.test(clean_df$ABV, conf.level = .95)
```
## 7.  Is there an apparant relationship between the bitterness of the beer and its alcoholic content?  Draw a scatter plot.  Make your best judgment of a relationship and EXPLAIN your answer.

* Higher ABV values are associated with higher IBUs and vice versa.  With p-value < 2.2e-16, there is sufficient evidence at alpha = .05 level of significance to suggest that the data is linearly correlated. Correlation estimate = 0.67 suggests that the relationship between IBU and ABV is positive and strong.

```{r, fig.width=10, fig.height=5}
# Plot ABV and IBU
ggplot(data = clean_df) +
  geom_point(mapping = aes(x = ABV, y = IBU, color=ABV), position ="jitter") +
  ggtitle("Alcohol Content & Bitterness of Beers") + xlab("Alcohol by Volume (ABV)") + ylab("International Bitterness Units (IBU)") +
  geom_smooth(mapping = aes(x = ABV, y = IBU)) 

#correlation
cor.test(clean_df$ABV,clean_df$IBU)

```

## 8.  Investigate the difference in IBU and ABV between IPAs and other Ales

* IPAs have higher average ABV and IBU than other ales.

```{r}

# Create a dataframe with only IPAs & Ales
ipa_ale_df <- clean_df %>% filter(str_detect(Style, 'IPA') |str_detect(Style, 'Ale'))

# Add a column for "IPA" or "Ale"
ipa_ale_df$beer_type = ifelse(grepl("IPA", ipa_ale_df$Style), "IPA", "Ale")

# two sample t-test compare ABV/IBU between IPA and Ale
t.test(ipa_ale_df$ABV[ipa_ale_df$beer_type=="IPA"],ipa_ale_df$ABV[ipa_ale_df$beer_type=="Ale"],conf.level = .95)
t.test(ipa_ale_df$IBU[ipa_ale_df$beer_type=="IPA"],ipa_ale_df$IBU[ipa_ale_df$beer_type=="Ale"],conf.level = .95)

# Split data into train and test data
# Train/Test with 70/30
splitPerc = .7
set.seed(4)

trainIndices = sample(1:dim(ipa_ale_df)[1],round(splitPerc * dim(ipa_ale_df)[1]))
train = ipa_ale_df[trainIndices,]
test = ipa_ale_df[-trainIndices,]

dim(train)
head(train)
dim(test)
head(test)
```

```{r}
# Run the KNN model on the train and test data with k = 5
classifications = knn(train[,c("ABV","IBU")],test[,c("ABV","IBU")],train$beer_type, prob = TRUE, k = 5)

# Create a confusion matrix of the results with k = 5
table(classifications,test$beer_type)
CM_KNN_IPA = confusionMatrix(table(classifications,test$beer_type))
CM_KNN_IPA

# Predict what Budweiser would be classified as
bud_test = data.frame(ABV = .05, IBU = 12)

classify_bud = knn(train[,c("ABV","IBU")], bud_test, train$beer_type, prob = TRUE, k = 5)
classify_bud
attr(classify_bud,"prob")

#IPA vs Ale
# Loop for many k and the average of many training / test partition
# to pick the best k for the model 

iterations = 200
numks = 30

masterAcc = matrix(nrow = iterations, ncol = numks)
  
for(j in 1:iterations)
{
accs = data.frame(accuracy = numeric(30), k = numeric(30))
trainIndices = sample(1:dim(ipa_ale_df)[1],round(splitPerc * dim(ipa_ale_df)[1]))
train = ipa_ale_df[trainIndices,]
test = ipa_ale_df[-trainIndices,]
for(i in 1:numks)
{
   classifications = knn(train[,c("ABV","IBU")],test[,c("ABV","IBU")],train$beer_type, prob = TRUE, k = i)
  table(test$beer_type,classifications)
  CM = confusionMatrix(table(test$beer_type,classifications))
  masterAcc[j,i] = CM$overall[1]
}

}

MeanAcc = colMeans(masterAcc)

plot(seq(1,numks,1),MeanAcc, type = "l")

```

```{r, fig.width=9, fig.height=5}

# Plot scatter plot for ABV and IBU of “Ales” and “IPAs”
ggplot(data = ipa_ale_df) +
  geom_point(mapping = aes(x = ABV, y = IBU, color=beer_type), position ="jitter") +
  ggtitle("IPA and Ales") + xlab("Alcohol by Volume (ABV)") + ylab("International Bitterness Units (IBU)") 

```

```{r, fig.width=10, fig.height=5}
ipa_ale_df %>%
select(ABV, IBU, beer_type) %>%
ggpairs(mapping = aes(color = beer_type)) 
```

* Here's a visual result of the kNN results looking at 5 nearest neighbors.  The decision boundary line indicates where a beer might get classified as either an IPA or an Ale. 

```{r}
# Boundary plot from Michael Hahsler:  https://michael.hahsler.net/SMU/EMIS7332/R/viz_classifier.html

  data <- data[,1:2]
  k <- length(unique(cl))

  plot(data, col = as.integer(cl)+1L, pch = as.integer(cl)+1L, ...)

  # make grid
  r <- sapply(data, range, na.rm = TRUE)
  xs <- seq(r[1,1], r[2,1], length.out = resolution)
  ys <- seq(r[1,2], r[2,2], length.out = resolution)
  g <- cbind(rep(xs, each=resolution), rep(ys, time = resolution))
  colnames(g) <- colnames(r)
  g <- as.data.frame(g)

  ### guess how to get class labels from predict

```


```{r, fig.width=12, fig.height=10}

# Boundary plot
decision_plot(model, x_test, class = "beer_type", main = "kNN (5)")

```

## 9a.  What states are closest to the Bud ABV/IBU profile?

Indiana and Michigan have the closest ABV and IBUs of the Budweiser brews.  

```{r}
# Run the KNN model on the train and test data and add the state parameter (Use all data to train/test)
classify_w_state = knn(train[, 4:5],test[, 4:5],train$State, prob = TRUE, k = 5)
classify_bud_st = knn(clean_df[, 4:5], bud_test, clean_df$State, prob = TRUE, k = 3)
CM_KNN_State = confusionMatrix(table(classify_w_state,test$State))
CM_KNN_State

#Run KNN model for 100 different k to find k with highest probabilities
bud_test = data.frame(ABV = .05, IBU = 12)
accs = data.frame(probability = numeric(100), k = numeric(100))

for(i in 1:100)
{
  classifications = knn(clean_df[, 4:5], bud_test, clean_df$State, prob = TRUE, k = i)

  accs$probability[i] = attr(classifications,"prob")[1]
  accs$k[i] = i
}

plot(accs$k,accs$probability, type = "l", xlab = "k")
accs %>% arrange(desc(probability))%>% slice(1:10)

#Find the states for k= 9,14

knn(clean_df[, 4:5], bud_test, clean_df$State, prob = TRUE, k = 9)
knn(clean_df[, 4:5], bud_test, clean_df$State, prob = TRUE, k = 14)

#Plot 
clean_df%>% filter(State=="ID" | State=="MI") %>% select(ABV,IBU,State)%>% ggplot(aes(x= ABV, y=IBU, color =State))+ geom_point() +ggtitle("Indiana and Michigan ABV/IBU")

med_abv_ibu%>% filter(State=="ID" | State=="MI")

```

## 9b. What states have a low number of breweries for the population?

New Jersey, Tennessee, and West Virginia have a low number of craft breweries for the population of those states.  

```{r}

# Find out what states have a low # of breweries compared to the state population using census data
# census_api_key("")

# Estimated median income
# us_inc <- get_acs(geography = "state", variables = "B19013_001")
# us_inc <-  subset(us_inc, select = c(NAME, estimate))
# setnames(us_inc, old=c("NAME","estimate"), new=c("id", "med_income_est"))

# Estimated population
# us_pop <- get_acs(geography = "state", variables = "B01003_001")
# us_pop <- subset(us_pop, select = c(NAME, estimate))
# setnames(us_pop, old=c("NAME","estimate"), new=c("id", "pop_est"))

# Merge population & median income
# (census_df <- merge(us_inc, us_pop, by="id"))

# Change the states to lower case so that you can merge it with the brew_by_state dataframe
# census_df$id <- tolower(census_df$id)

# Merge census data with the brew_by_state df
# brew_by_state_census <- merge(brew_by_state, census_df, by="id")

# Create a column for brewery ratio
# brew_by_state_census$brewery_ratio <- round(brew_by_state_census$pop_est/brew_by_state_census$count)

# Create one dataframe that has brew_by_state, census, and median ABV and IBU
# master_df <- merge(brew_by_state_census, med_abv_ibu, by="State")

# Sort
# master_df <- master_df[order(-master_df$brewery_ratio),]
# master_df_final <- subset(master_df, select = c(State, id, count.x, med_income_est, pop_est, brewery_ratio, med_abv, med_ibu))
# top_3 <- top_n(master_df_final, 3, brewery_ratio)

# View(top_3)
```

## Other:  Median IBU of the dataset

```{r}

#Summary of key statistics of IBU for the conclusions
summary(clean_df$IBU)
```

## Conclusions

* Indiana and Michigan have the closest ABV and IBUs of the Budweiser brews.  If Budweiser wants to consider opening new craft breweries in states where craft beer drinkers have similar taste to Budweiser, then these states should be considered.  Michigan has the third most craft breweries in the US based on our data, indicating that there is a lot of interest in craft breweries. 

* New Jersey, Tennessee, and West Virginia have a low number of craft breweries considering the population of those states.  If Budweiser wants to consider opening breweries that might have more demand, these states should be considered.  

* When comparing Budweiser to IPAs and other ales, Budweiser would be considered an ale.  

* The median ABV in the dataset is .057.  The median IBU is 35.  ABV and IBU have a strong positive linear correlation.  Budweiser ABV and IBU are very low compared to the other beers in the dataset.  Budweiser could consider creating a new craft beer with a higher ABV and IBU.
