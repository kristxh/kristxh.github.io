Hi, I'm Kristi.  I mostly from the great state of Texas, growing up in Houston and Corpus Christi, and now living in Austin.  I went to school in New York and have worked as a business systems analyst and product manager in the financial industry for the last fifteen years.  


I heart data.  Swimming and running and drinking wine too.
